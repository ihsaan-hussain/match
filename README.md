This project was created to help find a quick way to make a football match report for friendly football matches. Personally every Sunday there is a football session I go to which the players want to have a record of.
Therefore I have created an app to do just that. This is only a Beta version. I hope to keep adding to it and hopefully one day it will be big enough so that semi-professional leagues will use it as a quick and easy
way to record matches. Match reports can be used to study how to make a team better and how the outcome of the game could be different. Mtch reports were typically done on paper and are typically hard to read. A simple,
easy to read Excel file will provide an easy way to read the match report.
